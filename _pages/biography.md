Dr. Bobby R. Bruce is a Project Scientist at [UC Davis](
https://www.ucdavis.edu/) where he primarily works on the
[gem5 computer architecture simulator](http://www.gem5.org) as part of the
[Davis Computer Architecture Research group](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu)
(DArchR). Prior to UC Davis, Bobby carried out research into the automatic
optimization of Java bytecode within UCLA's
[Software Evolution and Analysis Laboratory](

Bobby completed his PhD in Software Engineering from [UCL](
https://www.ucl.ac.uk) in 2018, having been jointly supervised by
[Prof. Mark Harman](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman) and
[Dr. Justyna Petke](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/J.Petke), with
[Prof. Earl T. Barr](http://earlbarr.com/) as second-supervisor. His primary
research focus during this time was the automated improvement of software's
non-functional properties using [search-based software engineering](
